This file is related to LWR models simulation, including Greenshields, Newell-Daganzo, Greenberg, Underwood and the California model. The code is making the three-dimension figure. 

//Introduction/background

Transportation consistently holds a pivotal position in urban economies and the overall progress of nations. While traffic undoubtedly enhances people's lives, it also presents significant hidden perils, notably traffic congestion. To enhance transportation efficiency, scientists have perseveringly dedicated themselves to studying traffic flow, resulting in the proposal of numerous theories. 

//Aims and Objectives

This thesis aims to construct fundamental diagrams and three-dimensional simulations for five critical theories of traffic flow: Greenshields, Newell-Daganzo, Greenberg, Underwood, and the California model. The primary objective is to compare and analyze the efficacy of these simulations, draw conclusive insights into their characteristics, and offer practical recommendations for their specific applications.

//Achievements

This thesis has accomplished the construction of three-dimensional simulations that encompass three essential variables: density (œÅ), space (x), and time (t). Moreover, by conducting an extensive comparison of diverse illustrations, the thesis presents a thorough examination of the merits and drawbacks of the five equations, accompanied by perceptive recommendations for their future development.

//Conclusions / Recommendations

The Greenshields is the most basic and classical model, coming from practical observations and data. Based on Greenshields, Newell-Daganzo, Greenberg and Underwood all developed but still have advantages and disadvantages in specific conditions. In the future, you can consider using real-world data to detect, the specific application of the model, and improve accordingly.
